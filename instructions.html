                What is the goal of the game?<br>
                The goal is to score points and pass levels by having the snake eat magic berries while avoiding losing
                all the snake's lives. The higher the level you are playing on, the more points you have to score to get
                to the next level.<br><br>What kills my snake? When is the game over?<br>Your snake dies if its head
                collides with its body, with a rock or with another snake (in the two player mode). After a collision,
                your new snake restarts with five units long and is able to travel through the rocks for 2 seconds
                without losing an additional life. When all the snake's lives are gone, the game is over.
